Meeting with Comms Team and Zac, Thursday 1/16/20

Action Item: Figure out how to format the UHF beacon
The most robust beacon is cw, using a unique morse identifier so that we can easily see it on the waterfall. We would have to figure out how to make the fsk radio do a cw beacon (fsk modulate all 0s or 1s, just turn it on/off for pauses). As a proof of concept, morse out a test word (someone's call sign, etc).
Alternatively, a few hundred bits/second at fsk is slow enough to be visible on the waterfall as well. 300 baud fsk for beacon is good; any really low rate fsk with identifier and health data.

Sequence of Satellite Events:
After the cw beacon, switch over to LoRa packet with health data of the sat. After this transmission, listen for commands before going back to sleep.

Examples of health data to include:
up-time of satellite
current attitude
current power
software state
temperature

Use Pack C-struct or Base 64 (turns binary data into ascii text, safer to random weirdness)
All binary files are sent across the internet as Base64 files, as safe as plain text.
This adds a tiny bit of overhead, but is way safer.
Very standard, look for python libraries to do this. It could even be a python dictionary, and just serialize it out. We could also do JSON if we really wanted to.

Test packets with SDR (SDR Sharp is the software for Windows) with a waterfall on a laptop.
