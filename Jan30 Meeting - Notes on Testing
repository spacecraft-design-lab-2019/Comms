Notes for Testing the Radios:
Use a handheld yagi & a script to run through and find the optimal LoRa settings
-3 element hand-held Yagis are in the lab already, ~5-7 dbi
  -Could also buy some from AeroAntenna
-Take care to mount the satellite on wood handle or cardboard tube - no metal or humans!
  -Has to be more than a wavelength above the ground
-Get at least a km line of sight distance to get into the farfield

Once the settings are dialed in, use a variable attenuator or many fixed attenuators to see what happens
-Goal is to get a bit error rate / packet error rate

Optimal final test would be to go to Mt. Hamilton - has line of sight to most of campus
-No cell coverage, so find a way to communicate
-Should be done when we have the finished satellite & the ground station functional

After we get the optimal LoRa settings and a rough idea of the radio scaling, simulate the doppler shift in the lab
-Expect a doppler shift of ~10 kHz
-Doppler shift should be less of an issue when we have a higher LoRa frequency spread


Notes for "Beeping Protocols":
Send a CW beacon, then LoRa packet immediately after
-Use ASK/OOK protocol to send CW signal (heads up - may have misspelled the protocols)
-Send at least once a minute, probably want to make the beep frequency variable based on power voltage (low vs high power modes)
-We'll probably be able to communicate with the sat for like 5-6 minutes each pass (1-2 minutes for the worst passes)


Notes for Telemetry:
Microcontroller & other chips may have temperature sensors built in - could add to telemetry

ADCs are 12bit, so don't transmit a 32bit float for any value!
-Use fixed point numbers - basically rescaling, so make sure we know the full possible range of values for each variable
-Pack quaternions into 16 bit ints

Satellite knows its own orbital position to high precision!
-We should have it tell us precisely where it thinks it is
  -Full state vector (13 numbers)

Also want to keep track of number of resets
